## üé® Customizing Your Portfolio

This is where the fun begins! Here's how to make this portfolio truly yours:

### Changing Your Personal Information

All the content is in the `src/components/` folder. Open these files in your code editor and update the text:

1. **Hero.jsx** - Your name and main introduction
   - Change your name, title, and welcome message
   - Update the call-to-action button text

2. **About.jsx** - Your story and background
   - Write about yourself, your journey, and your interests
   - Add your personal touch!

3. **Skills.jsx** - Your technical skills
   - List the programming languages and tools you know
   - Add new skills as you learn them

4. **Projects.jsx** - Showcase your work
   - Add your projects with descriptions
   - Include links to live demos and source code
   - Replace placeholder images with your project screenshots

5. **Contact.jsx** - How people can reach you
   - Add your email, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
   - Update social media links

### Changing Colors (Optional)

Want to change the color scheme?

1. Open `tailwind.config.js` in your code editor
2. Look for the `colors` section
3. Change the color values to your preferred colors
   - Use hex codes like `#FF5733` or color names like `blue`
   - Try a color picker tool: https://colorhunt.co/

### Adding Your Profile Picture

1. Put your photo in the `public` folder
2. Update the image path in the relevant component
3. Make sure your image is optimized (not too large, under 500KB is good)

### Tips for Beginners

- **Make small changes**: Update one thing at a time and check if it works
- **Keep the server running**: Use `npm run dev` and see changes instantly
- **Save often**: Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac) to save your files
